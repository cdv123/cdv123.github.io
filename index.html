            <li> The <span class = "italic">British Interactive Media Association</span> (BIMA) recently revealed that tech workers are five times more likely to suffer from a mental health problem, compared to the wider population. Between four and 10 per cent of UK adults are thought to experience depression at some point in their lives but this figure pales in comparison to the tech sector, where as many as <span class = "bold">52 per cent </span>of the workforce admitted to suffering with stress, anxiety and depression at work. </li>
            <li>Two thirds of those surveyed stated that their work has caused high levels of stress, with 13 per cent of these workers experiencing this emotional strain on a constant basis. This work-based stress is also causing severe prolonged headaches, sleep deprivation and anxiety attacks. Stress is also more commonly experienced by women in tech, with BIMA finding that men were just nine per cent as likely to experience high levels of workplace stress.</li>

        <ul id ="why-text">
            <li>Employees may feel isolated and burdened by difficult projects or exhausted if they believe they have no control over their work. In addition, relentless and continuous change, common in tech, may significantly impact mental health. Long hours may also contribute to higher rates of absenteeism and more mistakes on the job. Employees may feel stressed by their workload, have inadequate training, or strive for unrealistic goals.</li>
            <li>Mental health should be considered as critical as physical health by technology firms, as a healthy work environment results in higher productivity and job satisfaction. </li>
