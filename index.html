            <li> The <span class = "italic">British Interactive Media Association</span> (BIMA) recently revealed that tech workers are five times more likely to suffer from a mental health problem, compared to the wider population. Between four and 10 per cent of UK adults are thought to experience depression at some point in their lives but this figure pales in comparison to the tech sector, where as many as <span class = "bold">52 per cent </span>of the workforce admitted to suffering with stress, anxiety and depression at work. <span class = "reference underline">(CPS Group, 2019)</span></li>
            <li>Two thirds of those surveyed stated that their work has caused high levels of stress, with <span class = "bold"> 13 per cent </span> of these workers experiencing this emotional strain on a constant basis. This work-based stress is also causing severe prolonged headaches, sleep deprivation and anxiety attacks. Stress is also more commonly experienced by women in tech, with BIMA finding that men were just nine per cent as likely to experience high levels of workplace stress. <span class = "reference underline" >(CPS Group, 2019)</span></li>

            <li>Solving the issue of employee mental health in the tech industry begins and ends with its leaders. Leaders must normalise conversations around mental health issues, communicate exactly what resources are made available, and offer flexible work options for their valuable employees.In most cases, this won’t require a complete overhaul of an organisation’s systems and processes – it can be as simple as holding regular meetings to remind employees what resources are available or empathetic conversations with individuals who seem to be struggling. <span class = "reference underline"> (Inbayuk, 2022) </span></li>
